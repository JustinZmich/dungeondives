		<h3>The Forgotten Altar</h3>
      <p>In my many days of travel there once was a place which I stumbled across unlike any other I had seen before. The rooms of this labyrinth were older than I, and dated far back before my ancestors even. This place was from a forgotten time yet, still served to house several nefarious characters.</p>
      <p>Stumbling through the front door you wouldn't expect much trouble. The main enterance is a quiet recess with a door in front of you and another to the right side...</p> <p>Where will you proceed next?</p>

		<h3>The Villains You'll Encounter...</h3>
      <p>Proceeding downstairs you notice a growing light from the chamber in front of you. A campfire flame burns with smoldering embers and illuminates the two figures in the room. One is hooded and robed sitting beside the fire, another is brawnier and wearing some armor, leaning on the left wall. You notice another door leading further down to your right.</p>
      <p>Behind another door within the Grand Hallway are two more nasty and nefarious creatures, the goblins. Beware for these creatures have darkvision, and are able to spot you befre you can see them.</p>
